Being a Junior System Admin, I remember this scenario

"The junior engineer, heart racing with first-day nerves, sat at a sleek desk in a buzzing open-plan office, the hum of keyboards and faint coffee aroma in the air. They opened a terminal on their new Linux laptop, typing sudo apt install docker.io with sweaty palms, only to wrestle with a cryptic dependency error that took an hour of frantic Googling to resolve."

And that moment pass by then after 9 months. Then I'm become Linux System Admin for 3 Months as a Goverment Contrator.
